# COVID-19-Scanner


The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2.
I have developed an iOS application using Deep Learning that can detect Pneumonia caused by NCOV-19 from x-Ray Images. It will help people to verify from the Pneumonia X-ray images whether it contains NCOV-19 or not. The model I used is currently a proof-of-concept that displays great accuracy, though with a very small test dataset. I need more data to improve its accuracy hence, please connect me to anyone you know that can potentially provide more COVID-19 images for model testing and training, or who can benefit from the model for their research.[The model seriously needs further validation from bigger and more diverse test sets because I had too few x-ray images (with overwhelmingly healthy and normal lungs) to test the model on. I hope someone can do further testing and improve my model once it fails!!!]

I need more data to make the model more accurate. Kindly connect me if you get sample data.

Note:- This is not a final product. This product is still in the research stage and under development. Therefore, do take it’s the result for granted. Please do contact specialist doctor if you have any symptoms of coronavirus.) 
We extend our gratitude to many sources who have helped us directly or indirectly in developing this app.
